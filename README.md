Welcome to the News App! This guide will help you set up and run the code on your local machine and test it using the Expo app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine.
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any code editor of your choice.
- A smartphone with the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/client) installed (available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository from GitHub or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-app.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

3. Open the terminal within the project directory.

4. Install Yarn globally (if not already installed):

    npm install -g yarn
    ```

5. Install project dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the App

6. Start the Metro development server by running:
